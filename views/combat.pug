    This section explains the mechanics of combat in Guild Wars 2. Although the
    game might look similar to many other MMOs, there are a few differences that
    are not immediately obvious, but which nevertheless are important.

  h2 Health

  p.
    Much like in other MMOs, combat in Guild Wars 2 is
    about hitting enemies to reduce their health bar (commonly referred to as
    their HP, short for 'hit points') to 0, while also preventing them from
    doing the same to you.

  aside.
    The game does not officially support any means to
    show the actual numbers for enemies' health, only a percentage; this is
    largely because the actual numbers can change on some enemies depending on
    how many players are attacking them.

  p.
    When you target an enemy (or friendly) by left-clicking on it, it will show
    up at the top of the screen in the centre as a small picture, a health bar,
    a short description of what it can do, and whatever effects are applied to
    it (see #[a(href='#boons-conditions') Boons &amp; conditions], below).

  p.
    Other nearby enemies also have a thin bar above them to indicate their
    health, just below their name.

  h2 Dodging and moving

  p.
    One of the main things that makes Guild Wars 2 combat feel very fluid is
    that almost all abilities can be activated while you are moving, and it's
    important to do so whenever possible to avoid damage, rather than standing
    there like a turret getting hit. The main exceptions to this are the various
    'channelled' skills - ones where your character is performing a long sequence
    of attacks that can take 2 or 3 seconds.

  p.
    #[dfn Dodging] is another fundamental aspect of combat: it prevents you from
    taking any damage for a brief time, allowing you to avoid heavy attacks that
    would otherwise take away a large amount of your health, or knock you over
    leaving you vulnerable.

  p.
    By default, the game is set up so you can double-press on a movement key to
    Dodge. This is unfortunate for two reasons: first, it's a little slower than
    pressing a single dedicated Dodge key, and second it can cause you to Dodge
    unintentionally on
    #[a(href='https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jumping_puzzle') Jumping Puzzles]
    when trying to perform many small, short movements.

  p.
    I strongly recommend disabling the double-press option and binding Dodge to
    a convenient key.

  h2 Attacking enemies

  p.
    The attacks available to you depend on two things: what profession (aka
    class) you're playinh, and the weapon(s) you have equipped. The latter point
    is very important: different weapon types each have their particular
    specialities, and you need to learn which ones are appropriate for a given
    encounter.

  p.
    For example, on a Warrior, using a Hammer gives you access to attacks based
    around controlling your enemy: knocking them down, pushing them away, or
    weaking their attacks. Alternatively, using a Mace and a Shield together is
    a more defensive setup, letting you block hits and interrupt attacks.

  h2 Knowing your attacks

  p.
    Each skill in the game has a tooltip explaining what it does: simply move
    the mouse pointer over it and a box appears detailing how much damage the
    skill does, its range, and so on. Here's an example:

  p.img: img(href='/skill-tooltip.png')

  p.
    The icons in the top right are important:

  dl
    dt: img(href='/skill-cast-time.png')
    dd.
      #[dfn Activation time]: also known as #[i cast time], this is simply how
      long it takes to activate a skill. If this is not present, it means the
      skill can be cast instantly,
      #[em even during the activation of another skill].

    dt: img(href='/skill-recharge.png')
    dd.
      #[dfn Recharge time]: also known as #[i cooldown], this is how long you
      must wait after activating a skill before you can use it again. If this is
      not present, there is a minimum recharge time of around half a second.

  p.
    The #[dfn range] of a skill, given in an arbitrary, unnamed unit, defines
    the maximum distance at which you can hit an enemy with the skill.
    #[strong If you're not in range, the skill will have a thin red bar below it],
    like this:

  p.img: img(href='/skill-out-of-range.png')

  p.
    It can be a little tricky to get used to what the different numbers mean.
    Generally, though, 200 is short range, 600 is medium range, and 1200 is long
    range. Getting a feel for these distances is mostly a matter of experience.

  h2#boons-conditions Boons &amp; conditions

  p.
    Like other MMOs, Guild Wars 2 has the concept of persistent positive and
    negative effects. Positive effects are split into two categories:

  dl
    dt Boons
    dd.
      These are short-term effects represented by an white icon on an orange
      background, with a white border indicating the time remaining on them.
      There are
      #[a(href='https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boon#List_of_boons') a small number of Boons],
      and they're shared across Professions, and include things like
      Regeneration, Might and so on.

    dt Buffs
    dd.
      These are Profession-specific effects, such a Guardian's
      #[a(href='https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strength_in_Numbers') Strength In Numbers],
      or effects from things like food or the environment.

  p Negative effects are also split into two categories:

  dl
    dt Conditions
    dd.
      Like Boons these are
      #[a(href='https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Condition#List_of_conditions') a specific set of short-term effects],
      represented by a black icon on a red background, with a black border to
      indicate the time remaining on them. Also like Boons, they are shared
      across the Professions, and include things like Bleeding, Vulnerability
      and so on.

    dt Debuffs
    dd.
      Like Buffs, these appear as full-colour icons above your skill bar, and
      can come from a variety of sources.

  p.
    Boons and Conditions are the primary short-term in-combat effects, usually
    only lasting a few seconds. With the right equipment and stats, they can be
    very potent, so it's important to decide what sort of playstyle you want to
    focus on: do you want to use raw power to kill enemies, or melt them down
    over time with powerful Bleeding and Burning effects? Perhaps you want to
    support your allies with Might, increasing the damage of their attacks, or
    provide Protection so they take less damage?

  h2 Controlling enemies

  p.
    There are 4 Conditions that affect enemy movement: Cripple, Chill, Fear and
    Immobilise. These along with other skills like Stuns, Dazes and Knockdowns
    are what is collectively known as #[dfn Crowd Control].

  p.
    Interrupting enemy abilities and controlling their movement is an important
    part of Guild Wars 2 combat
