    This guide is for players new to Guild Wars 2, whether they have previous
    MMO experience or not. I've tried to make as few assumptions about
    familiarity with terms and concepts as possible, even though they may seem
    obvious to veteran players. Naturally this can be a tricky line to walk -
    I don't want to risk over-explaining very basic things like 'loot'.

  h2 Creating a Character
  p.
    If you've already created your charactrer and have completed the initial
    story mission, you can skip this section and go straight to
    #[a(href='/combat') Combat].

  p.
    This section is not yet complete.
